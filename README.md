# Interpretable Models in ANNs

April 26, 2020

Artificial neural networks are often very complex and too deep for a human to understand. As a result, they are usually referred to as black boxes. For a lot of real-world problems, the underlying pattern itself is very complicated, such that an analytic solution does not exist. However, in some cases, laws of physics, for example, the pattern can be described by relatively simple mathematical expressions. In that case, we want to get a readable equation rather than a black box. In this paper, we try to find a way to explain a network and extract a human-readable equation that describes the model.
